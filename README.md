# NUMBER-THEORY-ALGORITHMS
THIS REPOSITORY CONSTAINS SOME BASIC ALGORITHM RELATED TO NUMBER THEORY LIKE THE DECOMPOSTION OF AN INTEGER IN PRIME FACTORS, CALCULATION OF PRIME NUMBERS AND THE EUCLIDEAN/DIVISION ALGORITHM TO FIND THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR OF TWO INTEGERS, CALCULATION OF CONTINUED FRACTIONS, CALCULATION OF THE P-ADIC EXPANSION OF INTEGERS AND RATIONAL NUMBERS. FURTHER ALGORITHMS WILL BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE.


OBSERVATION: THE MOST EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS TO COMPUTE THE FACTORS OF A VERY LARGE NUMBER ARE THE GENERAL NUMBER FIELD  SIEVE AND THE QUADRATIC SIEVE BUT THEY INVOLVE HIGHLY COMPLEX CONCEPTS IN NUMBER THEORY, OUT OF THE SCOPE OF THIS REPOSITORY (I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL MATHEMATICIAN). BUT THERE'S SOME IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE ALGORITHM IN LANGUAGES LIKE C/C++ EASILY AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.

I DON'T IMPLEMENT THE AKS_PRIMALITY_TEST WHICH IS A DETERMINISTIC TEST FOR THE PRIMALITY OF INTEGERS AND THE MOST EFFICIENT FOR VERY LARGE NUMBERS. IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ALGORITHM WHICH REQUIRES A DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF NUMBER THEORY. BUT I PROVIDE A SLIGHTLY CHANGED VERSION OF THE LAST STEP OF THIS ALGORITHM USING BINOMIAL EXPANSION.

BUT GOOD IMPLMENTATION ARE ALSO AVAILABLE ONLINE:
